1. What is UBBD?
	UBBD is Userspace Backend Block Device.

2. Why we need UBBD?
	a) block device driver upgrade online.
	b) driver bug dont crash kernel.
	c) Dont reinvent the wheel.
		Some block storage especially cloud storage has a userspace library
	but there is no linux kernel driver to use it. ubbd can make it very easy
	to enable linux block device driver for it via library.
3. Who:
	Who would use UBBD?
	Who should not use UBBD?

4. How does UBBD work?

5. Roadmap:
	kernel driver:
		- support unmap --force
		- add timeout for cmd
		- support more parameter in add netlink, e.g: discard, writezero_bytes
	framework:
		- start new process for each dev rather than thread
	drivers:
		- generic_bd
			- file							[Done]
			- null
		- kv_bd
			- rocksdb_backend_bd
		- cloudstoraget_bd
			- s3_bd
			- ceph_rbd						[Done]
		- virtual_bd
			- qcow
			- vdi
			- ...
		- multi_bd
			- raid
			- cache
		- spdk_bd
